        <h1>Welcome to Xuyang's Webpage</h1>
        
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I am currently a sophomore enrolled in Brooklyn College, with the intent of pursuing Computer Science as a career. 
            I am very passionate about exploring the opportunities that develop me and my career readiness. 
            I seek to develop skills and knowledge that will allow me to understand and utilize computer software more. 
            I submitted this resume to your institute because I believe the programs you offer has what it takes to motivate and prepare me for a career. 
            I have volunteered at many community centers, as well as employment experiences as a sales representative at a branded department store. 
            And through those experiences, I have developed the necessary skills to interact with clients, coordinate with peers, manage my schedule and time, and be flexible overall.
